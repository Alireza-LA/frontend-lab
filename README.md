## 🧩 About This Repository

This repo is my **frontend practice lab**, where I experiment with:
- UI challenges from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/).
- Semantic HTML5.
- Modern CSS (Flexbox, Grid, animations).
- JavaScript for interactivity.
- Responsive design and accessibility best practices.

Each folder represents a completed challenge.  
This repo helps me **track progress**, **refine code quality**, and **document learning**.
