# 🧪 Frontend Lab

A collection of my **Frontend Mentor** solutions — where I turn beautiful designs into clean, responsive, and accessible web interfaces.  
Each project lives in its own folder and includes the original challenge, my solution, and notes on what I learned.

## 🧩 About This Repository

This repo serves as my **frontend practice lab**, where I experiment with:
- Real-world UI challenges from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/).
- Clean and semantic HTML5.
- Modern CSS (Flexbox, Grid, and animations).
- JavaScript for interactivity and logic.
- Responsive design and accessibility best practices.

Each subfolder represents a completed challenge.  
I use this space to **track my progress**, **refine my code quality**, and **document what I learn**.
